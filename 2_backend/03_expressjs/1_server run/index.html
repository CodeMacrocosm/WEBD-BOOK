This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.

#nodemon 
to auto start our server we use nodemon which is an npm package
$ npm install -g nodemon 
to run it always use 
nodemon server.js instead of node server.js
