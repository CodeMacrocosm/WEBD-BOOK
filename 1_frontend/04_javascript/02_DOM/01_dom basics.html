<!-- DOM = DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL

    IT HAS properties and methods

    properties : it describes about the object
    methods : it does 

    real life eg: car is a object
    it has properties like color, no of seats, no of door 
    it has methods like move(), drive(), park(); 

    difference btw method and function is that 
    methods are assoiated with objects 
    so methods can be functions but functions cant be methods

    code eg: buttons 
    it has properties like innerHTML, style, firstChild,
    it has methods like click(), appendChild(), setAttribute. 

    the properties have get methods which is used on the lhs of = 
    the properties have the set methods which is used after the = and it assigns a value 

    the methods have call methods which is used before the =
